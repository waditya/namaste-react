1. Difference between dev and prod code is that prod code is highly optimized. 
Be it libraries, photos, bundling, etc

2. NPM (NPM manages packages but it does not stand as Node Package Manager)
NPM is a standard repository for all the packages, libraries and utilities. 

3. When we create a basic react app with boiler plate code, npm is added to it by default.

4. package.json consists the configuration for npm. 
5. Bundler is important dependency. It helps to bundle the .html, .css, .js, etc files 
This helps to ship the code to Production.
Examples - webpack , parser, wheat
